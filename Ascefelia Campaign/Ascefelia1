#Campaign
So you dare explore the depths of darkness?
Foolish mortal, it will be the end of you!

As you explore Ascefilia, you come upon someone in the street.

She turns around and hisses as you approach, her eyes glow a bright yellow.
You turn to runaway, but you're not fast enough.

You turn to fight, but can you defeat her?
