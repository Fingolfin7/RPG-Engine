# RPG-Engine
Python program that creates text based RPGs read in from text files

##Sections
Text files contain sections that are denoted with `#'s`, including:
  `#Character` section where different characters and character stats can be defined, and
  `#Campaign` section where the dialogue and actions are defined

##Test
Run the `Region.py` file to play the example campaign (contained in the 'testParser' file)

##More soon
I will be adding to, and refining the repository over time.
