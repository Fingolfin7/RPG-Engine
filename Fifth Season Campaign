[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset]: Ah, little one. Here you are

[green][bold]Syenite[reset]: No. No.

[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset]: There's no need for these histrionics, Damaya
Then he pauses, looks apologetic.
[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset]: [green][bold]Syenite[reset].

She has not seen him in years, but his voice is the same. His face is the same. He never changes.

[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset]: And what is this?
[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset] smiles, his gaze fixing on Coru in her arms. 
[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset]: How lovely. Alabaster's?

***There are moments when everything changes, you understand***

[green][bold]Syenite[reset]: No... No. No. No.

His smile fades.
[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset]: [green][bold]Syenite[reset]. I told you. Never say no to me.

***Even the hardest stone can fracture.It just takes the right force, applied at the right juncture of angles. A fulcrum of pressure and weakness***

***You understand these moments, I think, instinctively. It is our nature.We are born of such pressures, and sometimes, when things are unbearable-***

He stops
[38;5;196m Schaffa[reset]: [green][bold]Syenite[reset]- 
[green][bold]Syenite[reset]: That's not my rusting name! I'll say no to you all I want, you bastard!

***-sometimes, even we... crack***

So she reaches up. Out. The amethyst is there, above, waiting with the patience of the dead, as if it somehow knew this moment would come.
She reaches for it now and prays that Alabaster was right about the thing being too much for her to handle.
And as her awareness dissolves amid jewel-toned light and faceted ripples, as [38;5;196m Schaffa[reset] gasps in realization and lunges for her, as Coru's eyes flutter shut over her pressing, smothering hand-
She opens herself to all the power of the ancient unknown, and tears the world apart.
